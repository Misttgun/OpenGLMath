# Math OpenGL Project
Small OpenGL project for our math class.

The objective of the class was to implement a small software that could do the following:
- Cutting (windowing) any polygons using a convex polygonal window. (Sutherland-ogdmann algorithm)
- Filling of any polygons by the LCA algorithm

We were two on the project:
- Vincent Girardot
- Maurel Sagbo
